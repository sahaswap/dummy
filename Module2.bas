'==================================================================
' OSINT Automation Tool
'
' Runs a batch of Google OSINT searches for a customer and their
' counterparties, saves each result page as a PDF straight into
' the ECM case folder, and writes an audit trail back to the
' workbook and the shared SharePoint tracker.
'
' Headless Edge does the heavy lifting. A small worker pool lets
' a couple of searches run in parallel so a typical 20-30 search
' job finishes in a few minutes instead of the better part of ten.
'
' v3.5 adds a search-mode prompt right at the start of the run:
'   Fast      - headless, 2 workers, modest jitter. Quickest.
'   Optimised - headless, 2 workers, much wider jitter. Same
'               fingerprint as Fast, far less bursty request
'               pattern - trades run time for fewer CAPTCHA hits.
'   Visible   - real, visible Edge windows, no headless
'               fingerprint at all. Slowest; keep hands off mouse/
'               keyboard while it runs.
'
' To run: assign "SearchAndSavePDF_Direct" to your macro button.

'   2. Client Hints mismatch. Chromium derives its Sec-CH-UA

'      update them. So the UA header claimed 131 while the
'      Sec-CH-UA headers sent the actual installed version on the
'      very same request - a flat self-contradiction that's
'      trivial to check for and that no genuine browser produces.
